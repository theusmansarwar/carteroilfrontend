          Carteroil started in 1893 under the vision of John Joyce Carter. The
          company grew into a global brand and shaped the energy sector over
          time. It played an early role in the rise of Standard Oil and
          influenced the growth of Exxon. Its history is tied closely to the
          story of petroleum. The company expanded beyond the United States and
          reached Latin America, the Caribbean, and other global markets. People
          know Carteroil today for reliability, innovation, and quality. Each
          milestone shows its resilience, adaptability, and focus on progress.
